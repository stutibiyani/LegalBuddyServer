Right To Request Additional Privacy Protections    You have the right to request that we further restrict the way Kaleida Health uses and discloses your health information to treat your condition, collect payment for that treatment, or run our business operations.

You may also request that we limit how we disclose information about you to family or friends involved in your care. For example, you could request that we not disclose information about a surgery you had. To request restrictions, please write to the Kaleida Health Privacy Officer, 726 Exchange Street Suite 200, Buffalo, NY 14210.
